Hi I'm Keanan,

I am a recent data science graduate from Flatiron. I have a B.A degree in Environmental Studies with a concentration in renewable energy systems from Denison University. My interest in sustainability and data science developed through my athletic pursuits in NCAA Division III Cross Country and Track & Field. Through my passion for analyzing race data and creating running routes and trail maps, I strengthened my appreciation for the environment and realized an appreciation for detailed data-driven results. Since college I have transitioned to running marathons and further purused my passions for data science.
