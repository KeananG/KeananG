Hi, I'm Keanan!

I recently graduated from Flatiron as a data science student. I hold a B.A. degree in Environmental Studies with a concentration in renewable energy systems from Denison University. My passion for sustainability and data science grew while participating in NCAA Division III Cross Country and Track & Field. Analyzing race data, creating running routes, and designing trail maps deepened my appreciation for the environment and sparked my interest in data-driven results. Since college, I've transitioned to running marathons while continuing to pursue my passion for data science.

Feel free to check out my capstone project: [![ClassiFire](https://img.shields.io/badge/ClassiFire-black?logo=github&style=flat-square&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/KeananG/WildFires_capstone)

âš¡ Fun fact: I enjoy fixing bikes ðŸš² and spending time outdoors, engaging in activities like cycling, cross country skiing, running, and hiking.
